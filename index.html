				<h2></h2>

				<p>Hey there! I’m Firat Selcuk. I work as a Software Development Engineer in Test, which means I
					spend my days making sure the software we use is as good as it can be. I grew up in Antakya, Turkey,
					a place with a lot of history, and I like to think that’s where I got my mix of being
					detail-oriented and creative from.

				<p>My job is all about testing software to catch any issues before they reach the user. It’s a bit like
					being a detective, but for code. I love diving into the nitty-gritty of software, finding out what
					makes it tick, and figuring out how to make it even better.

				<p>When I’m not knee-deep in code, you’ll probably find me in the kitchen trying out new recipes or
					outdoors, soaking up nature. Cooking is my way of taking a break and experimenting with different
					flavors and techniques. It’s a lot like coding, but with food! And there’s nothing like a good hike
					or bike ride to clear my mind and get inspired.</p>

				<p>I think being good at my job means bringing together the best of both worlds: the precision of
					engineering and the creativity of exploring new ideas, whether that’s in tech, on a plate of food,
					or somewhere out in the mountains.</p>

				<p>I’d love to connect, whether it’s about work, the latest tech trends, or just to exchange a cool
					recipe or two. Don’t hesitate to get in touch. Let’s see what we can create together!</p>
